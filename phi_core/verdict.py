"""Verdicts: decide float at the seam, consume exact downstream.

Pattern, third independent use (holographic_enhancement: motion static mask,
depth median split, router mode verdict): a boundary float comparison
producing an exact boolean verdict that integer selects consume. Both
substrates call the SAME conversion, so verdicts agree structurally -- never
re-derive the comparison downstream (a second mapping is a mirror waiting
to drift).

Contract: verdict_mask(x, thr, op) with op in {"==","<=",">="} returns an
exact bool array. Inclusivity is STATED per op (">=" engages at equality).
NaN input is a caller bug: NaN comparisons are False under every op, which
would silently verdict False; callers with untrusted inputs assert finiteness
first (all current uses operate on finite fields by construction).
